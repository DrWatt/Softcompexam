Exam code for Software and Computing for Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics course. 

## Description

The project consists on a small application based on a Neural Network model developed using the Keras library. It aims to simulate the bunch-crossing assignement done by the TwinMux breadboard in the muon tracking system of CMS. This is done by supplying 15000 (for now) tracks to the NN for training. I have trained the NN on the Colaboratory platform developed by Google, due to the long time needed in order to complete the process.

The entire ROOT tree used to popolate the database can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5cywqqkcv04649l/DTTree_zMuSkim_70k.root?dl=0
